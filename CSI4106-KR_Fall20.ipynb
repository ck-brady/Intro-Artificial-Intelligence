    "When reading text, understanding the type of entities with the text helps extract additional information about the entity. Through the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER), we are able to determine whether an entity is a Person, Organization, Country, ... When exploring text online, we also occassionally see entities have clickable links to webpages with more information on the entity. This is a form of enhancing the text to allow readers to easily access the information needed to understand each entity from the text and its content.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be revisiting the Covid-19 related news dataset from notebook 7 to explore how we can improve spaCy's NER disambiguation and enhance the text from the news articles through the use of entity linking. This will be done in two parts, where we first use text coherence for NER disambiguation and then perform text enhancement with entity linking.    \n",

Another example is Gary Moore/CBC labeled (partially) incorrect as a PERSON. CBC should be labeled separately as ORG. This error is due to an earlier NLP pipeline step not delimating this token correctly.

    "Now that you saw that spaCy NER does not always perform correctly, we will try to use text coherence to modify the NER types that spaCy gave.  In fact spaCy assigns the entity types one sentence at a time.  But when looking a the whole document, and knowing that text is usually coherent, we can do some post-processing to spaCy's NER module and correct some mistakes.  By text being coherent, we mean, for example, that if a person is referred to with a particular name, e.g. *McGeer*, chances are that each time we see *McGeer* in the document, it is the same person.  So it is unlikely that *McGeer* would be once a person and once an organization.  It is not always true, but it is a common assumption.  Therefore, we will explore two different strategies to use text coherence to post-process the output from the spaCy NER module.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first strategy (*explored in Q2/Q3*) is to find, among all NER types assigned, which is the most frequent one.  For example, the entity *Bourouiba* was assigned 1 time GPE, and 3 times PERSON, so this information can be used to modify the GPE type and change it to PERSON.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second strategy (explored in Q4) is to try to find a longer form in the text.  Since that longer form should be less ambiguous, we can use it to disambiguate the shorter, more ambiguous forms.  For example, *Lydia Bourouiba* occurs in the text and is assigned PERSON.  We can use that information to assign further occurrences of the short form *Bourouiba* to also be PERSON.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we defined these two strategies, they can be combined in different ways. So, in Q5, you are asked to combine both strategies in a post-processing component for spaCy NER module.   Of course, using this text coherence will not work every time, and will unfortunately introduce some errors...  But let's try."

COVID-19 has brought research into other medical conditions to a grinding halt. Ending Quebec\\'s lockdown could mean freedom for some, but not for all. The pandemic is giving some countries political cover for controversial acts. INTERACTIVE |\\xa0See the latest data on coronavirus cases\\xa0in Canada. Have a coronavirus question or news tip for CBC News? Email: Covid@cbc.ca  The federal government has announced a $1.1-billion plan\\xa0to marshal Canada\\'s scientific community in the fight against the coronavirus, as some provinces with relatively fewer cases begin to weigh how they will relax restrictions put in place to slow the spread of\\xa0COVID-19. Scientists around the globe are scrambling to come up with tests, treatments to lessen the severity of the disease and\\xa0ultimately, a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus that has killed more than 2,000 Canadians and almost 200,000 people worldwide. At his Thursday news conference outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was putting in place a three-point medical and research strategy. WATCH | Trudeau lays out the government\\'s strategy: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion strategy to fund COVID-19 medical research and a task force to study immunity. 3:53 This plan includes:  $155 million for research on vaccines and other treatments, support for clinical trials\\xa0and expanding national testing and modelling.\\xa0 $662 million for clinical trials led by Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling of COVID-19, including a COVID-19 immunity task force that includes Dr. David Naylor, Dr. Catherine Hankins, Dr. Tim Evans, Dr. Theresa Tam and Dr. Mona Nemer.  In mid-March, the Trudeau government\\xa0committed $275 million for research, as part of the first emergency aid package. That was supplemented later in the month with the creation of a new strategic innovation fund, which provided another $192 million to specific companies and research institutions working on the development of drugs and vaccines. A laboratory technologist at LifeLabs demonstrates one of the steps taken when a specimen is tested for COVID-19 at the company\\'s lab in Surrey, B.C., on March 26. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) As well, the government has provided $52 million through national granting councils to almost 100 research teams across the country. With several provinces beginning to talk cautiously about reopening the economy, which has been virtually shut down since mid-March, the pressure is on to find reliable, rapid tests to determine who is infected with the virus and who has developed immunity to it. Saskatchewan\\'s reopening plan Saskatchewan became the first province Thursday to outline a concrete plan\\xa0for how some businesses and services could be allowed to resume next month provided\\xa0the number of cases there stays low.\\xa0 Premier Scott Moe said\\xa0restrictions will be lifted\\xa0May 4 for dentists\\' offices, optometry clinics and physical therapy providers. Golf courses will reopen\\xa0May 15 and retail shops selling clothing, books, flowers and sporting goods might be allowed to open their doors on May 19. A runner and walker keep their distance from each other on the Charlottetown boardwalk in late March. P.E.I. is among the provinces eyeing the relaxation of some COVID-19-related restrictions. (Brian McInnis/CBC) Hairdressers and barbers could also start seeing clients again on May 19, but employees working directly with the public would have to wear masks. Physical distancing and strict cleanliness standards would have to be maintained through every phase.\\xa0 For the next\\xa0phases\\xa0— for which there are no start dates yet —\\xa0officials would consider lifting restrictions on indoor and outdoor recreational and entertainment facilities and bumping up the size of allowable gatherings to 30 people from the current 10. The final phase of the plan would include\\xa0lifting restrictions on crowd sizes, visits to long-term care facilities and non-essential travel. Moe has already said those will stay put for some time. The government\\'s plan doesn\\'t provide a timeline for when gyms might be allowed to operate or when daycare capacity might be increased. Nor does it give a time frame for food services and restaurants to reopen, but when they do, they will be expected to operate at half their capacity. Prince Edward Island, where the COVID-19 caseload is low, is aiming to ease measures put in place to slow the spread in late April and reopen businesses in mid-May. \\'Not exactly islands\\'\\xa0 Dr. Craig Jenne, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Calgary, said easing restrictions in one province could present challenges for others. \"Many provinces in Canada have no hard borders,\" he said in an interview with The Canadian Press. \"Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba — we are not exactly islands where we can cut off travel between provinces. \"We are going to have to make sure we\\'re on the same page with this.\" \\'Failing our parents, our grandparents\\': Trudeau Trudeau said\\xa0the military will respond to provincial requests for assistance at long-term care facilities. But he said\\xa0the measure is a short-term solution and that Canada should not need soldiers to take care of seniors. \"If you\\'re angry, frustrated, scared, you\\'re right to feel this way. We can do better. We need to do better. Because we are failing our parents, our grandparents, our elders.\" WATCH | Should long-term care homes be federally regulated? Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with reporters on Thursday. 1:12 The comments today followed requests by Ontario and Quebec on Wednesday for hundreds of soldiers to help long-term care facilities that have been hit hard by COVID-19. The Canadian Armed Forces is now assessing what more it can provide to respond to these requests. Trudeau said\\xa0the government is sending the military to help in long-term care homes in Ontario and Quebec\\xa0—\\xa0130 troops were sent to help five long-term care facilities in Quebec last week\\xa0—\\xa0but said\\xa0it should never have come to this, and there are tough questions to be asked once the crisis is over. The outbreak of COVID-19 in long-term care homes has outraged many Canadians and Trudeau said\\xa0that outrage is not misplaced. WATCH | Dr. Nathan Stall says there wasn\\'t enough attention paid to long-term care residences during pre-pandemic planning: Dr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician from Sinai Health System, says there wasn\\'t enough attention paid to long-term care residences during pre-pandemic planning. 1:16 During his daily briefing Thursday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose mother-in-law is in a long-term care home and has just tested positive for COVID-19,\\xa0paused to gather himself before pledging to improve Ontario\\'s long-term care system. \"I recognize the system is broken,\" he later said. WATCH | Doug Ford\\'s full response: His voice cracking, Ontario Premier Doug Ford vowed to \\'do better\\' for the people in long-term care facilities. 1:27 Quebec resident Jonathan Marchand, who has muscular dystrophy, told CBC News\\xa0that it\\'s not only the elderly who are vulnerable in those long-term care institutions.\\xa0 \"It\\'s not a safe environment,\" he said. \"What I want is to get out of here.\" WATCH | Quebec man talks about feeling unsafe in his long-term care home: Quebec long-term care resident Jonathan Marchand, who has muscular dystrophy, says he wants the right to be cared for outside of an institution. 5:08 Thousands of layoffs in transportation The pandemic also continues to wreak havoc on\\xa0the Canadian economy.

Here\\'s a look at what\\'s happening in the U.S. From The Associated Press and Reuters, updated at 7:30\\xa0p.m. ET The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed a $484 billion US bill to expand federal loans to small businesses impacted by the coronavirus outbreak and hospitals overwhelmed by patients suffering from COVID-19. By a vote of 388-5, the House passed the measure, which was unanimously approved on Tuesday by the Senate. It now goes to President Donald Trump for signing into law.\\xa0 The House also approved a select committee, with subpoena power, to probe the U.S. response to the coronavirus. It will have broad powers to investigate U.S. preparedness, how federal dollars are being spent, and Trump administration deliberations. That aid came as another\\xa04.4 million Americans filed for government jobless benefits for the first time last week, as joblessness continues to hit the U.S. economy at a breathtaking pace.

(David Dee Delgado/Getty Images) The figure brings the total number of newly jobless people in the United States\\xa0in the past five weeks to more than 26 million. That\\'s more than the entire number of new jobs created in the U.S. economy since the financial crisis of 2008.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo) (John Minchillo/Associated Press)\\xa0 Meanwhile, shares of American pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences fell more than\\xa0four\\xa0per cent Thursday, after the Financial Times reported its experimental coronavirus drug failed its first randomized clinical trial. The report cited draft documents published accidentally by the World Health Organization. In a statement on Friday, Gilead said the post included inappropriate characterizations of the study and that the study was terminated early due to low enrolment and, as a result, it was underpowered to enable statistically meaningful conclusions. Here\\'s what\\'s happening around the world From The Associated Press and Reuters, updated at 7:30 p.m. ET European Union leaders edged forward on Thursday toward joint financing of an economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic\\xa0by agreeing to ask the European Commission to work out the details of such common support.

(Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images) Still, a decision is likely months away as member countries disagree on how much financial aid should be given out.\\xa0 Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands all opposed recovery aid through grants, while a broader northern camp — including Germany — were in favour of linking a new Recovery Fund to the bloc\\'s next long-term budget for 2021-27, sources said.   EU holds critical virtual summit on setting yearslong budget in a time of pandemic   Hard-hit Italy called for a Recovery Fund of 1.5 trillion euros\\xa0($2.3 trillion Cdn) as well as grants to member states, while French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe\\'s response required financial transfers to the hardest-hit states, and not just loans. Macron also said the European project had no future if member states failed to respond to the \"exceptional shock.\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The World Health Organization said it would announce a \"landmark collaboration\" on Friday to speed development of safe, effective drugs, tests and vaccines to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19. The Geneva-based agency, in a brief statement issued late on Thursday, said the initiative with partners aims to make technologies against the disease caused by the novel coronavirus \"accessible to everyone who needs them, worldwide,\" but gave no details. With more than 22,000 officially recorded deaths, officials in Spain are now preparing for rolling back some of the strict lockdown\\xa0restrictions. The confinement has helped slow the daily contagion rate increase from more than 20 per cent\\xa0to less than two\\xa0per cent, although Spain has not been testing widely and the real contagion is believed to be higher.

China also said on Thursday\\xa0it would donate a further $30 million US to the World Health Organization, about a week after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that U.S. funding would be halted while Washington reviewed the WHO\\'s role \"in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\"\\xa0 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is planning to return to work as early as Monday after being hospitalized earlier this month with COVID-19, the Telegraph reported, even as the U.K.\\xa0economy is crumbling under the strain of the coronavirus lockdown.

Thus, you only need to ensure that if at least one entity of the same surface form contains the NER type and is in the text, then all instances of those entities are updated.

COVID-19 has brought research into other medical conditions to a grinding halt. Ending Quebec\\'s lockdown could mean freedom for some, but not for all. The pandemic is giving some countries political cover for controversial acts. INTERACTIVE |\\xa0See the latest data on coronavirus cases\\xa0in Canada. Have a coronavirus question or news tip for CBC News? Email: Covid@cbc.ca  The federal government has announced a $1.1-billion plan\\xa0to marshal Canada\\'s scientific community in the fight against the coronavirus, as some provinces with relatively fewer cases begin to weigh how they will relax restrictions put in place to slow the spread of\\xa0COVID-19. Scientists around the globe are scrambling to come up with tests, treatments to lessen the severity of the disease and\\xa0ultimately, a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus that has killed more than 2,000 Canadians and almost 200,000 people worldwide. At his Thursday news conference outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was putting in place a three-point medical and research strategy. WATCH | Trudeau lays out the government\\'s strategy: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion strategy to fund COVID-19 medical research and a task force to study immunity. 3:53 This plan includes:  $155 million for research on vaccines and other treatments, support for clinical trials\\xa0and expanding national testing and modelling.\\xa0 $662 million for clinical trials led by Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling of COVID-19, including a COVID-19 immunity task force that includes Dr. David Naylor, Dr. Catherine Hankins, Dr. Tim Evans, Dr. Theresa Tam and Dr. Mona Nemer.  In mid-March, the Trudeau government\\xa0committed $275 million for research, as part of the first emergency aid package. That was supplemented later in the month with the creation of a new strategic innovation fund, which provided another $192 million to specific companies and research institutions working on the development of drugs and vaccines. A laboratory technologist at LifeLabs demonstrates one of the steps taken when a specimen is tested for COVID-19 at the company\\'s lab in Surrey, B.C., on March 26. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) As well, the government has provided $52 million through national granting councils to almost 100 research teams across the country. With several provinces beginning to talk cautiously about reopening the economy, which has been virtually shut down since mid-March, the pressure is on to find reliable, rapid tests to determine who is infected with the virus and who has developed immunity to it. Saskatchewan\\'s reopening plan Saskatchewan became the first province Thursday to outline a concrete plan\\xa0for how some businesses and services could be allowed to resume next month provided\\xa0the number of cases there stays low.\\xa0 Premier Scott Moe said\\xa0restrictions will be lifted\\xa0May 4 for dentists\\' offices, optometry clinics and physical therapy providers. Golf courses will reopen\\xa0May 15 and retail shops selling clothing, books, flowers and sporting goods might be allowed to open their doors on May 19. A runner and walker keep their distance from each other on the Charlottetown boardwalk in late March. P.E.I. is among the provinces eyeing the relaxation of some COVID-19-related restrictions. (Brian McInnis/CBC) Hairdressers and barbers could also start seeing clients again on May 19, but employees working directly with the public would have to wear masks. Physical distancing and strict cleanliness standards would have to be maintained through every phase.\\xa0 For the next\\xa0phases\\xa0— for which there are no start dates yet —\\xa0officials would consider lifting restrictions on indoor and outdoor recreational and entertainment facilities and bumping up the size of allowable gatherings to 30 people from the current 10. The final phase of the plan would include\\xa0lifting restrictions on crowd sizes, visits to long-term care facilities and non-essential travel. Moe has already said those will stay put for some time. The government\\'s plan doesn\\'t provide a timeline for when gyms might be allowed to operate or when daycare capacity might be increased. Nor does it give a time frame for food services and restaurants to reopen, but when they do, they will be expected to operate at half their capacity. Prince Edward Island, where the COVID-19 caseload is low, is aiming to ease measures put in place to slow the spread in late April and reopen businesses in mid-May. \\'Not exactly islands\\'\\xa0 Dr. Craig Jenne, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Calgary, said easing restrictions in one province could present challenges for others. \"Many provinces in Canada have no hard borders,\" he said in an interview with The Canadian Press. \"Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba — we are not exactly islands where we can cut off travel between provinces. \"We are going to have to make sure we\\'re on the same page with this.\" \\'Failing our parents, our grandparents\\': Trudeau Trudeau said\\xa0the military will respond to provincial requests for assistance at long-term care facilities. But he said\\xa0the measure is a short-term solution and that Canada should not need soldiers to take care of seniors. \"If you\\'re angry, frustrated, scared, you\\'re right to feel this way. We can do better. We need to do better. Because we are failing our parents, our grandparents, our elders.\" WATCH | Should long-term care homes be federally regulated? Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with reporters on Thursday. 1:12 The comments today followed requests by Ontario and Quebec on Wednesday for hundreds of soldiers to help long-term care facilities that have been hit hard by COVID-19. The Canadian Armed Forces is now assessing what more it can provide to respond to these requests. Trudeau said\\xa0the government is sending the military to help in long-term care homes in Ontario and Quebec\\xa0—\\xa0130 troops were sent to help five long-term care facilities in Quebec last week\\xa0—\\xa0but said\\xa0it should never have come to this, and there are tough questions to be asked once the crisis is over. The outbreak of COVID-19 in long-term care homes has outraged many Canadians and Trudeau said\\xa0that outrage is not misplaced.
